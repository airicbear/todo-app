# ToDo App

## Inspiration

I was inspired to make this app as a challenge for the MLH Local Hack Day 4.
I am very new to the Swift programming language and decided that this would be a good opportunity to learn more about Swift.

## What it does

This app manages a list of things to do.

## How we built it

I used Swift and Xcode and created a new Command Line application.

## Challenges we ran into

I'm not very familiary with Swift syntax so I ran into some problems with mutation permissions and getters and setters, so I resorted to using a list of Strings.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I'm proud of building one of my first applications in the Swift programming language.

## What we learned

I learned about pattern matching and using local storage in Swift.

## What's next for ToDo App

Instead of using a list of Strings, consider using a list or dictionary of TodoItems where each TodoItem could have various properties including categories, status, priority, etc.

## Built With

- swift
